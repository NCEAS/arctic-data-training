<ul>
<li>Observations about different entities combined</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/table-denorm.png" /> In the above example, each row has measurements about both the <code>site</code> at which observations occurred, as well as observations of two individuals of possibly different species found at that site. This is <em>not normalized</em> data.</p>
<p>People often refer to this as <em>wide</em> format, because the observations are spread across a wide number of columns. Note that, should one encounter a new species in the survey, we wold have to add new columns to the table. This is difficult to analyze, understand, and maintain.</p>
</div>
<div id="tabular-data" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.8.2</span> Tabular data</h3>
<p><strong>Observations</strong>. A better way to model data is to organize the observations about each type of entity in its own table. This results in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate tables for each type of entity measured</li>
<li>Each row represents a single observed entity</li>
<li><p>Observations (rows) are all unique</p></li>
<li><p>This is <em>normalized</em> data (aka <em>tidy data</em>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Variables</strong>. In addition, for normalized data, we expect the variables to be organized such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All values in a column are of the same type</li>
<li>All columns pertain to the same observed entity (e.g., row)</li>
<li>Each column represents either an identifying variable or a measured variable</li>
</ul>
<p>Here‚Äôs an example of tidy (normalized) data in which the top table is the collection of observations about individuals of several species, and the bottom table are the observations containing properties of the sites at which the species occurred.</p>

<div id="primary-and-foreign-keys" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.9</span> Primary and Foreign Keys</h2>
<p>When one has normalized data, we often use unique identifiers to reference particular observations, which allows us to link across tables. Two types of identifiers are common within relational data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary Key: unique identifier for each observed entity, one per row</li>
<li>Foreign Key: reference to a primary key in another table (linkage)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in the second table below, the <code>site</code> column is the <em>primary key</em> of that table, because it uniquely identifies each row of the table as a unique observation of a site. Inthe first table, however, the <code>site</code> column is a <em>foreign key</em> that references the primary key from the second table. This linkage tells us that the first height measurement for the <code>DAPU</code> observation occurred at the site with the name <code>Taku</code>.</p>

<div id="entity-relationship-model-er" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.10</span> Entity-Relationship Model (ER)</h2>
<p>An Entity-Relationship model allows us to compactly draw the structure of the tables in a relational database, including the primary and foreign keys in the tables.</p>
<p><img src="images/plotobs-diagram.png" /> In the above model, one can see that each site in the <code>SITES</code> table must have one or more observations in the <code>PLOTOBS</code> table, whereas each <code>PLOTOBS</code> has one and only one <code>SITE</code>.</p>

<div id="merging-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.11</span> Merging data</h2>
<p>Frequently, analysis of data will require merging these separately managed tables back together. There are multiple ways to join the observations in two tables, based on how the rows of one table are merged with the rows of the other.</p>
<p>When conceptualizing merges, one can think of two tables, one on the <em>left</em> and one on the <em>right</em>. The most common (and often useful) join is when you merge the subset of rows that have matches in both the left table and the right table: this is called an <em>INNER JOIN</em>. Other types of join are possible as well. A <em>LEFT JOIN</em> takes all of the rows from the left table, and merges on the data from matching rows in the right table. A <em>RIGHT JOIN</em> is the same, except that all of the rows from the right table are included with matching data from the left. Finally, a <em>FULL OUTER JOIN</em> includes all data from all rows in both tables (and is rarely practical).</p>
<p><img src="images/sql-joins.png" /> In the figure above, the blue regions show the set of rows that are included in the result. For the INNER join, the rows returned are all rows in A that have a matching row in B.</p>
