__Dates__: October 19 - October 23, 2020<br>
__Location__: Online
__Venue__: [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu), 735 State St., Suite 300, UC Santa Barbara
The Arctic Data Center provides training in data science and data management, as these are critical skills for the stewardship of the data, software, and other research products that are preserved in the Arctic Data Center. A goal of the Arctic Data Center is to advance data archiving and promote reproducible science and data reuse. This 5-day workshop will provide researchers with an overview of best data management practices, data science tools and concrete steps and methods for more easily documenting and uploading their data to the Arctic Data Center.

## Overview:

Workshop topics will include:

* Arctic Data Center and NSF Standards and Policies
* Data Management Plans
* Effective Data Management for Data Preservation
* Publishing Data at the Arctic Data Center
* Data and Metadata Quality
* Provenance for Data and Software


For more detailed information on how to prepare for the workshop, see preparing for the workshop (below).

## Preparing for the Workshop

### Required software

We will primarily be using a web browser, `R`, RStudio, and `git`. Please be sure these are all installed on your laptop, as follows:

- **R:** We will use R version 3.6.2, which you can download and install from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com)

- **RStudio**: To download RStudio, visit [RStudio's download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
  *If you don't know how up to date your version of RStudio is, please download an updated copy and install it*

- **R packages:** Please be sure you have installed or updated the following packages:

    - devtools
    - dplyr
    - DT
    - ggplot2
    - leaflet
    - tidyr
    - EML
    - dataone
    - datapack
    - sf

    You can install these packages quickly by running the following two code snippets:

    ```r
    packages <- c("dataone", "datapack", "devtools", "dplyr", "EML", "ggplot2", "readxl", "tidyr", "EML", "dataone", "datapack", "sf")
    ```

    ```r
    for (package in packages) {
      if (!(package %in% installed.packages())) {
        install.packages(package)
      }
    }
    ```

- **git:** [Download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it on your system.
- **GitHub:** We will be using [GitHub](https://github.com) so you will need create (or remember your existing) GitHub login

### Refresh your skills

This workshop assumes a base level of experience using R for scientific and statistical analyses.
However, we realize that not everyone will be at the same place in terms of familiarity with the tools we'll be using.
If you'd like to brush up on your R skills prior to the workshop, check out this list of resources we like:

- Learn R in the console with [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/)
- The [Introduction to R](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html) lesson in [Data Carpentry's R for data analysis](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/) course
- The Stat 545 [course materials](https://stat545.com/r-basics.html)
- The QCBS [Introduction to R](https://qcbs.ca/wiki/r) lesson (in French)

If you're a fan of cheat sheets, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) provides some fantastic ones on their [Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) page.
*Please make sure to print ahead of time if you prefer hard copies.*
In particular, check out:

* Base R
* Data Import
* Data Transformation with dplyr
* R Markdown
* Data Visualization with ggplot2
* R Markdown Reference Guide
