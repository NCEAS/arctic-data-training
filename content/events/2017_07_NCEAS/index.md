__Dates__: July 31 - Aug 1, 2017<br>
__Location__: Santa Barbara, CA<br>
__Venue__: [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu), 735 State St., Suite 300, UC Santa Barbara
The Arctic Data Center provides training in data science and data management, as these are critical skills for the stewardship of the data, software, and other research products that are preserved in the Arctic Data Center. A goal of the Arctic Data Center is to advance data archiving and promote reproducible science and data reuse. This 2-day workshop will provide researchers with an overview of best data management practices, data science tools and concrete steps and methods for more easily documenting and uploading their data to the Arctic Data Center.

## Course overview

The [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io) conducts training in data science and management,
both of which are critical skills for stewardship of data, software, and other
products of research that are preserved at the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io).

Course topics will include:

- Arctic Data Center and NSF Standards and Policies 
- Data Management Plans 
- Effective data management for data preservation
    - Storing and Preparing Data in Open Source Formats 
    - Stability, longevity, interoperability 
    - Metadata 
- Publishing data at the Arctic Data Center
    - Web-based submission
    - Automating submission for large data sets
- Data and Metadata Quality
- Provenance for data and software
